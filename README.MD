*** Patricks Bookshelf ***

A full stack application build by Piper Bates in order to organise their partner Patricks extensive book collection. 

*** PLAN ***

The first goal was just to create a database with a basic front end that displayed books in a table, and a function to add and remove books from the library. I created a RESTful API with postgresql and heroku and filled in some dummy data to create the add and delete functions.

Current functionaily of Patricks Bookshelf:
* Add new book
* Delee individual book
* View book on its individual page

Current WIPs:
* Search function by title - Currently only displays in the console

Future plans:
* Authentication so only Patrick can add or delete books (Priority)
* Search function, lets you search by title, author, series, read / unread, or whether you've leant it out.
* Edit function, lets you edit books so if you've read it, or leant it out / got it returned, you can update it, or perhaps correct the spelling.
    * Following on from edit function - have a simple front end toggle feature that changes whether the book has been read.

* A second table with author information so you can look at all books by a particular author
