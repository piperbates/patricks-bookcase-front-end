## About Patricks Bookcase

This app was the first fullstack app I build using a combination of React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL etc. Built as a side project alongside my projects at the School of Code bootcamp, for my partner Patrick who has a lot of books with no cataloging solution. 

## MVP Reached! 
The MVP for Patricks Bookcase was pretty straight forward; I wanted the user to be able to log in, add books, delete books, and search their catalogue. This has now been implimented! Wahoo!

## Next steps
* Edit function ~ The obvious next step from here is to have an edit function so the user can edit individual books, so if there are typos as well as being able to change the Read and Leant statuses of the book. 
    - To start with, just read and leant status, but ultimately being able to edit the entire book
* Search by Read status ~ Optional search based on whether the user has read the book or not.
* Search by Leant status ~ Optional search based on whether the user has Leant the book out, and to who.

## Larger goals
* Create a secondary table (and potential a third / fourth) for author, genre, and series. Be able to click on an author / genre / series and be taken to a page with all matching books, with links to those individual books. 

## Big Dreamer Goal
* Have multiple users!
